# kromatik

A Clojure library designed to converts between namespaced map and unnamespaced map.

## Usage

```clojure
(:require
   [kromatik.core :as km])
```

### A single namespace is given for entire map

```clojure
(km/->ns-map {:a 1 :b 2} :hello)
=> #:hello{:a 1, :b 2}
```

### A detailed paths for different namespaces is given

```clojure
(km/->ns-map
    {:a 1 :b 2}
    {:hello #{:a}
     :bye #{:b}})
=> {:hello/a 1, :bye/b 2}

(km/->ns-map
     {:a 1 :b 2}
     {:hello #{:a :x :y :z}
      :bye #{:b}})
=>  {:hello/a 1, :bye/b 2}
```

### turn namespaced map into unnamespaced map

```clojure
(km/->bare-map
    {:xyz/a 1 :zyx/b 2})
=> {:a 1 :b 2}

(km/->bare-map
    {:xyz/a 1 :b 2})
=> {:a 1 :b 2}
```
